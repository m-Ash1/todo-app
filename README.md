### Useful resources

- [Color Picker Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/colorpick-eyedropper/ohcpnigalekghcmgcdcenkpelffpdolg) - This helped me to pick colors not in the style guide and I use this extension a lot in several projects.
- [Flexbox Zombies](https://mastery.games/flexboxzombies/) - This is an amazing website/game and helped me a lot to understand the concept of flexbox and practice on it with a funny story game.
